This is a project that contains samples of my programming work. 
Since most of my professional work is under NDA these projects are inspired by tasks I've done, but in no way contain any NDA related material.

Parse Logs
--------
- Imagine having a system that writes analytic data using verb/noun combinations to log files.
- This is a self contained sample system that parses log files (sample log files provided) when requested verb/noun combinations are searched from a user interface.
- Once parsed the information stored in the log files is displayed to a user in table format.
- You can find a [demo here](http://samples.nicolefamulare.com/parseLogs/index.html)
